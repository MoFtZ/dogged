# Dogged API Reference

Dogged consists of two different projects that you can use to manage Git
repositories.

## [Dogged](dogged/Dogged.html)

The Dogged project is a set of high-level APIs for working with Git
repositories from .NET.

These are the APIs that are recommended for all users.

## [Dogged.Native](dogged.native/Dogged.Native.html)

The Dogged.Native project is a set of low-level PInvoke APIs that act as
bindings for the [libgit2 project](https://libgit2.org/).

These APIs are used internally by Dogged, but are also provided for
consumers who need to use low-level APIs.
